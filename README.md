[**See project status announcement**](https://github.com/rindeal/libfprint-vfs_proprietary-driver/issues/8)

## What

[libfprint](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fprint/libfprint/) driver for:

- VFS451 (138a:0007)
- VFS471 (138a:003c)
- VFS491 (138a:003d)
- VFS495 (138a:003f)
- \+ some others, but I've disabled them since FOSS alternative exists

This driver is remotely based on an ancient patch created by the sensors'
manufacturer (_Validity Sensors, Inc._) for an ancient version of libfprint.
I wasn't able to find the original source, but you can find the patch floating
in the internets.

## Why

The driver from that manufacturer's patch represented just a tiny middleware
for a proprietary _libvfsFprintWrapper.so_ library, which itself was used for
communication with a proprietary daemon _vcsFPService_ which was finally
communicating with the fingerprint reader via USB API exposed by the Linux
kernel.

This approach proved to be very buggy and worked just about 50% of time, the
other half you ended up with a nasty lockup (not to mention the inherent risks
of loading a closed-source proprietary library into the calling process' memory
space).

So what I did in this project was to separate the proprietary binaries
completely by creating a dedicated process which loads the proprietary library
and then just sends back the scanned image via a pipe.

This way both binary components (the lib and the daemon) can be sanitized,
sandboxed, whatever, ....

I also brought this driver up the spec for the latest libfprint API which was
introduced with v0.8.0, but since changed again, so some rework will have to be
done when v0.9.0 is released.

I understand that this driver is still far from optimal, but there is still no
open-source driver available for these sensors (although there are some
reverse-engineering efforts underway for other sensors -
[nmikhailov/Validity90](https://github.com/nmikhailov/Validity90),
[hmaarrfk/Validity91](https://github.com/hmaarrfk/Validity91)).

## How

### Automatic setup

If you use [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage) you can just install
[`sys-auth/libfprint` package from my ebuild repo](https://github.com/rindeal/rindeal-ebuild-repo/tree/master/sys-auth/libfprint)
with `vfs_proprietary-driver` USE-flag enabled.

#### For Arch Users

If you are on arch linux, you can install it from Arch User Repository (AUR)
using package name
[libfprint-vfs_proprietary-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libfprint-vfs_proprietary-git/)

### Manual setup

How to fit everything together is specific to every Linux distribution, so I
cannot describe it step by step, but the final architecture should look like
this:

```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph Some app
    subgraph libfprint
      vpd[vfs_proprietary-driver]
    end
  end

  subgraph Proprietary layer
    subgraph vfs_proprietary-capture-helper
      lfw[libvfsFprintWrapper.so library]
    end

    vfd[vcsFPService daemon]
    lu[libusb-0.1]
  end

  lk[Linux kernel]

  subgraph Hardware
    uh[USB Hub]
    fr[Fingerprint reader]
  end

  vpd --Pipes IPC--> lfw
  lfw --Custom IPC--> vfd
  lfw --> lu
  vfd --> lu
  lu --> lk
  lk --> uh
  uh --> fr
```

Up-to-date script to compile _libfprint_ with this driver enabled is
[here](https://github.com/rindeal/libfprint-vfs_proprietary-driver/blob/master/.ci/script)

**Notes:**

### Proprietary binaries

They can be downloaded from
[here](https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp84501-85000/sp84530.tar).

The laptop I developed this driver on is from Hewlett-Packard, so I'm using a
driver package from this vendor, but it's possible that you can find these
binaries elsewhere, too.

From all the files in this archive, we're going to use only two of them:
`vcsFPService` and `libvfsFprintWrapper.so`.

- `vcsFPService` is a daemon which has to be running for this driver to work at
  all
- `libvfsFprintWrapper.so` is a shared library used to handle communication
  with `vcsFPService` daemon and is the only proprietary component this driver
  uses directly

### `vfs_proprietary_capture-helper`

This small utility is built together with the driver, is installed into
`libexec` dir by default and the driver will have it's installation path
hardcoded into itself.

It links dynamically to the proprietary shared library
`libvfsFprintWrapper.so`.

This utility has rpath hardcoded to the directory containing
`libvfsFprintWrapper.so`, so you can place the proprietary library even under
non-standard directory (eg. `/opt`).

To customize the path to this dir see
[Assumptions and options](#assumptions-and-options) section.

## Assumptions and options

The build system assumes the shared binary library is installed in
`/opt/validity-sensor/usr/lib64`.

If that's not the case on your installation you can change the path by defining
`libvfsFprintWrapper_dir` Meson variable prior to calling the
`subdir(VFS_PROPRIETARY_DIR)` Meson command.

In order to prevent lockups, the driver will return an error if no fingerprint
is scanned within a hardcoded time window.

This timeout can be set with `VFS_PROPRIETARY_CAPTURE_HELPER_TIMEOUT`
preprocessor definition. How you pass it to the preporcessor is at your
discretion.

The filename of and/or the path to the utility used for handling the binary
library can be set with `VFS_PROPRIETARY_CAPTURE_HELPER_PATH` cpp macro.
